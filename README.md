# CladeClub Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

## What is a CIP?

A CladeClub Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a design document providing information to the CladeClub community, or describing a new feature for CladeClub or its processes or environment. The CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

## CIP Types

There are three types of CIPs:

- **Standard Track CIPs** describe any change that affects most or all CladeClub implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed changes to the client architecture, etc.
- **Informational CIPs** describe a CladeClub design issue, or provide general guidelines or information to the CladeClub community, but do not propose a new feature. Informational CIPs do not necessarily represent a consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational CIPs or follow their advice.
- **Process CIPs** describe or propose a change in process. This includes changes to the decision-making process, changes to the tools used in the CladeClub development process, and changes to the tools used in the CladeClub development process.
